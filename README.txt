# Spaghettis

Yet another fork of Pure Data < https://puredata.info/ >.

< http://msp.ucsd.edu/ >

An attempt to make it simple, fast, and embeddable.

Remark:

    This is an (AT YOUR OWN RISK) work-in-progress version.

Build:

    On macOS install ActiveTcl 8.6.6 first.
    Download this repository.
    Open a terminal and go to the "build.sh" script.
    Run the "./build.sh" command.
    Note that to avoid conflicts nothing is installed.
    On GNU/Linux execute "spaghettis/build/bin/spaghettis".
    Launch the "Spaghettis.app" on macOS.

Residual:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Spaghettis/
    ~/.spaghettisrc
