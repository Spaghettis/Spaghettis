#X text 96 360 There is also a facility for making many copies of a patch which track any changes you make in the original. The subpatches are called abstractions. For example \, here's a simple abstraction that sends a number to a "receive" on command:;
#X obj 96 468 sendnumber 45 cookies;
#X msg 300 432 bang;
#X obj 300 456 sendnumber 67 pretzels;
#X floatatom 588 456 0 0 0 0 - - -;
#X text 96 672 note that "\$1" \, etc \, has a different meaning in object boxes (open one of the "sendnumber" abstractions for comments.);
#X text 96 588 If you change one copy of an abstraction the change isn't automatically made on any other copies. You must keep track \, save the changes \, and cause Pd to reload the other copies (for example \, by closing and reopening the containing patch.);
#X obj 504 432 r cookies;
#X obj 588 432 r pretzels;
#X text 96 492 There is a separate file in this directory named "sendnumber.pd" which is loaded every time you type "sendnumber" in a box. Click on a "sendnumber" box above to see it. You can make changes in the subpatch and save them. The changes will be saved back to sendnumber.pd and not as part of this (containing) patch.;
