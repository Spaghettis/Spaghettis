#X text 420 108 There is also a facility for making many copies of a patch which track any changes you make in the original. The subpatches are called abstractions. For example \, here's a simple abstraction that sends a number to a "receive" on command:;
#X obj 48 312 sendnumber 45 cookies;
#X msg 252 276 bang;
#X obj 252 300 sendnumber 67 pretzels;
#X floatatom 540 300 0 0 0 0 - - -;
#X text 96 636 note that "\$1" \, etc \, has a different meaning in object boxes (open one of the "sendnumber" abstractions for comments.);
#X text 96 540 If you change one copy of an abstraction the change isn't automatically made on any other copies. You must keep track \, save the changes \, and cause Pd to reload the other copies (for example \, by closing and reopening the containing patch.);
#X obj 456 276 r cookies;
#X obj 540 276 r pretzels;
#X text 96 432 There is a separate file in this directory named "sendnumber.pd" which is loaded every time you type "sendnumber" in a box. Click on a "sendnumber" box above to see it. You can make changes in the subpatch and save them. The changes will be saved back to sendnumber.pd and not as part of this (containing) patch.;
